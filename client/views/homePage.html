    <h3>Understanding Our Skill Levels</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Beginner:</strong> This level is designed for those with up to 4 weeks of experience. 
        We recommend starting with at least 3 to 4 classes per week to build a solid foundation.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Intermediate:</strong> The general consensus is that students move into the intermediate level 
        between their 1st and 6th month, depending on their eagerness and learning proficiency.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Advanced:</strong> Progression to advanced classes typically begins after 6 to 8 months of 
        consistent training. At this stage, you can begin beginner sparring classes and advanced techniques, 
        eventually moving toward mock boxing matches at our gym.

    <h3>Our Class Types</h3>

    <p>
        <strong>Bagwork:</strong> These classes encourage you to learn about the different types of bags used 
        in boxing. You will learn to control your force, experiment with different styles, and build strong 
        wrist stability while maintaining safety.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>101 and 201 Series:</strong> These numbered classes indicate the level of intensity. 
        201 classes feature more complex combinations, increased cardio demands, and high-intensity HIIT movements.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Time-Based Classes:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Fast-45:</strong> A quick boxing session paired with HIIT cardio and minimal rest,
            designed for those with a busy schedule.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>60-Blast:</strong> A full hour-long intensive class.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>15-Rounds:</strong> An activity-based class where the instructor determines the
            intensity of the rounds based on the day's focus.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Women’s and Queer Boxing Classes</h3>

    <p>
        Some classes are designed as identity centered spaces (for example, <strong>Women’s Boxing</strong> or
        <strong>Queer Boxing</strong>). These classes are intended to create a supportive environment where participants
        can train with comfort and confidence.
    </p>

    <p>
        If a class is labeled as restricted (e.g., “Women only” or “Queer only”), please attend only if you identify with
        that group. If you are unsure whether a class is the right fit, the best approach is to ask staff privately.
        Our team will help you choose an option that respects everyone’s space.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>How to verify without being rude:</strong> If you’re not sure, you can say:
        “Hi! I want to be respectful can you confirm who this class is intended for and what the attendance guidelines are?”
    </p>
</section>

<!-- Section outlining community guidelines and respectful conduct -->
<section id="community-guidelines">
    <h3>Community and Respect</h3>

    <p>
        Train hard, but treat people kindly. Please be respectful regardless of age, gender, race, creed, nationality,
        background, or experience level. Everyone is here to learn, improve, and feel safe.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you make a mistake (wrong class, wrong assumption, or misunderstanding), a quick apology and a willingness to learn
        goes a long way. When in doubt, ask staff—privately and politely.

    <h3>Safety Protocols</h3>

    <p>
        Your safety is our top priority. Please follow all mandatory safety guidelines. A medical clearance or doctor’s note
        may be required if necessary, and we recommend keeping your insurance information readily available.
        You may not attend a class without proper headgear, approved gloves, hand wraps, and a mouthguard.
